Status Report #1

	Up until this point, I've been working on the lexer skeleton. I have the basic skeleton complete, but the moment of truth for debugging will either require a complete replacement of the lex return statements to include debugging or a finished bison file. I'd prefer the latter, so my next step will be the grammar of the bison file which will hopefully be done by next week.

	The sum total of my contributions to the project will likely be steps 3, 6 and 8, all revolving around bison and flex. Once I finish those, I will diverge to QA like in the NumbersProject.
