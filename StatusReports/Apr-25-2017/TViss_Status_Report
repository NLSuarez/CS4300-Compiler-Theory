Status Report #2

  Since the last progress report I have not accomplished much in the way of writing code. I finished up the code for taking in and renaming a source file and cleaned up code/added comments for readability. Otherwise I have been pretty lost on what I can contribute so I have been spending extra time reading the book to hopefully strengthen my understanding.
