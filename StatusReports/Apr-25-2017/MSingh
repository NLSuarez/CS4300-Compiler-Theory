Since the last status report, I've worked on the project by adding in the grammar rules in the parser. I've also put in time
to get the previously coded error routines to be properly compiled on the older version of bison on the lab machines. I was trying to the
%code requires block to redefine the YYLTYPE struct to include the filename and highest error level encountered so far, but it turns out
this doesn't work in bison 2.3. Instead I've now implemented a global variable to keep track of the highest error level encountered
and decided not keep track of the filename as it isn't necessary.
