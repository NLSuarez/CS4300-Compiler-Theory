Status Report #2

	Due to less than optimal group mates in other classes, I have not been able to contribute as much to this project as I would like. I've done some bits of the parser, particularly in the form of token declaration, and have also written some of the node types/ast structures that we will need. I will be helping as much as I can afford to on the AST code, parser and eventually translation to VMQ. Right now, I mainly just work on what I can as time allows.
